there should be a "config" file in the directory where cassandra_eval.jar is exported on the aws instance.
the config file should contain the seed address, to which client driver connects when it is executed.

GettingStarted.java contains the source code for java client driver of cassandra.

run the script "Cassandra.sh" to start experiment.

Result.jar is the jar file for Result.java that calculates the Result of experiment and outputs to result.txt *look into Result.java if necessary*
