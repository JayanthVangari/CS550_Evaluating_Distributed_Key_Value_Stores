there should be a "config" file in the directory where oracle.jar is exported on the aws instance.

the config file should contain the hosts address, to which client driver connects when it is executed.

Oracle.java contains the source code for java client driver of cassandra.

oracle.sh has 2 command-line arguments, the kvstore name and the number of nodes in the cluster . *change the arguments according to number of nodes in the cluster and the kvstore name that is given*

run the script "oracle.sh" to start experiment.

Result.jar is the jar file for Result.java that calculates the Result of experiment and outputs to result.txt *look into Result.java if necessary*
