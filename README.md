# CS550_Evaluating_Distributed_Key_Value_Stores

The project evaluates the implemented key-value store that uses a Distributed Hash Table  with the existing Distributed Key value stores Cassandra, Oracle NoSql and ZHT(A Zero-Hop Distributed Hash Table) by running 100k insert , lookup and delete operations. The experiments are run on amazon Ec2 instances with scales up to 16 nodes.
